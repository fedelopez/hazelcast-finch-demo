#Hazelcast trial 

This demo web app uses 

* [Twitter's Finch](https://github.com/finagle/finch) as backend and 
* [RXJs](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) as front-end

**Note** use `chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security`

##Todo

* Map/reduce example (wip)
* Serve web app static content so we don't have to disable web security on Chrome
